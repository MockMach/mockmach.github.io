    <h1>About {{ site.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ site.title }} is a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> based application built for a pragmatic purpose.  Why Jekyll?  Because in the end, your web application is HTML, and Jekyll does a great job of generating your HTML from simple markup.  Jekyll has the side benefit of being the engine that host <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github pages</a>, so you can host your mock-ups online, for free.</p>

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>The core purpose of {{ site.title }} is to allow developers and designers an elegant way to present working websites to clients.</p>
    <p>The main goals of MockMach are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create fully interactive, working HTML mock-ups</li>
      <li>easily drop in or remove html sections and blocks</li>
      <li>leverage existing tools and frameworks</li>
      <li>deployable to a free hosting environment</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Future</h1>
    <p>{{ site.title }} was created by me, <a href="http://dereknutile.com/" target="_blank">Derek Nutile</a>, for my own evil purposes.  To that end, I have only added the functionality I need.  Here are some future items I would like to build in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>expand beyond Bootstrap</li>
      <li>create a bucket of template layouts and sections for easy drop-in</li>
      <li>review and document the upgrade process with Jekyll</li>
      <li>...more to come</li>
    </ul>
